"""The Bloomberg extraction panel: file upload, merge, validate, download.

Rendering only. Parsing, merging and validation live in
``forecasting_engine.extraction`` and know nothing about Streamlit. The cached
Fama-French download is shared from ``forecasting_engine.ingest``.

The validation report renderer is shared between this page and the Home
page's summary — that sharing is the whole integration between the two.

Targets and signals are uploaded separately (Phase 4.1 of the ingestion plan):
which files are the two forecasting targets is a structural choice made here,
at ingestion, not inferred later on the Models page and not left to a free
column picker — a target column can no longer end up in the signal set by
construction, whatever it's named.
