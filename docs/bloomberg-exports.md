# Uploading Bloomberg exports

The dashboard accepts Bloomberg's original history exports, one file per
security, either as **CSV** or as **Excel (`.xlsx`)**, and joins all fields on
date. Do not rename columns, substitute fields or manually convert the files
into a separate signal-CSV format. Which format you actually get depends on
how your Bloomberg access produces the export — both are accepted so you
don't need to convert one into the other by hand.

## What to export

Export the histories needed for the analysis, as either CSV or `.xlsx` — no
need to pick one over the other for the app's sake. `PX_LAST`, `PX_BID`,
`TOT_RETURN_INDEX_GROSS_DVDS` and other numeric Bloomberg fields can coexist
in the same file.

**A CSV export** is a metadata block, a blank line, then a table whose first
column is `Date`:

```
Security,SPX Index
Start Date,1/1/2016
End Date,12/31/2025
Period,Daily

Date,PX_LAST,PX_BID
1/4/2016,2012.66,#N/A N/A
```

Trailing empty metadata cells, such as `Security,SPX Index,`, are accepted.
Placeholder-only fields are removed after merging because they carry no data.

**An `.xlsx` export** is a workbook with a `Data` sheet (`Date` plus one
column per field, same shape as the CSV table above) and a `Metadata` sheet
naming what was pulled — the security is read from the `Metadata` sheet, not
guessed from the filename, since a filename has been observed to disagree
with what a file actually contains.

### Target indices

Signals are open: export whatever the analysis needs. The two **targets** are
not. They are fixed, and both are forecast on a **total-return** basis
(dividends and coupons reinvested), never the plain price series:

| Role | Security | Field |
|---|---|---|
| Equity target | `SPX Index` | `TOT_RETURN_INDEX_GROSS_DVDS` |
| Bond target | `LBUSTRUU Index` | `TOT_RETURN_INDEX_GROSS_DVDS` |

**The bond target is the US Aggregate, `LBUSTRUU`** — decided 17 Sep 2026. The
earlier exports used `LEGATRUU`, the *Global* Aggregate. That is a different
index with a different calendar, not a relabelling, so it needs re-exporting
rather than renaming.

The calendar difference matters. The US Aggregate follows the US bond market,
which is closed on days the NYSE is open (Columbus Day, Veterans Day). On those
days a merged file has a row but no bond price. That blank is correct and must
stay blank: a target is never forward-filled, because a filled price on a closed
day reads as a real trading day and turns into a return that never happened.

## Converting

On the **Data** page, drop every export (CSV or `.xlsx`, mixed together is
fine) into the one multi-file uploader. The page joins them on date, labels
fields by security, validates their generic shape and reports gaps and
statistically unusual moves. Nothing needs a command line and no temporary
signal CSV is produced.

**Dates in a CSV export** are `m/d/yyyy` or `d/m/yyyy` depending on the
terminal's locale, and for any day up to the 12th the two look the same. The
reader settles the order once per file from every date in it, the metadata's
start and end dates included: a day above 12 anywhere decides it, and a file
with none is read month first, Bloomberg's default. A file that mixes the two
is refused rather than guessed. If a merged file's dates look a month out,
check the terminal's date format setting.

The merged Bloomberg CSV is downloadable directly. Fama-French factors are
downloaded only when requested, cached by content hash, and can then be
downloaded separately or alongside Bloomberg data in a workbook.

### What it does not do

**Gaps are left as gaps.** Different indices keep different trading calendars.
Across a real ten-year pull the union was 2,610 dates with all signals present
on only 2,499 of them — `spx_close` missing 97, `vix` 65, the spreads around 80.
Those cells are left empty, which the contract treats as missing data. Filling
them here would hide from the data quality report the very thing it exists to
report; forward-filling happens later, capped and counted.

**Range breaches are flagged, not corrected.** If almost every value in a column
falls outside its documented range, the converter says so — that pattern means
the wrong field was exported. A handful of breaches is left alone, because a
genuine market dislocation looks a lot like an outlier.
