    a given date is what was actually observable on that date.

    The horizon is counted in the target's own trading days — the rows where
    ``price_col`` has a value — not in rows of ``frame``. A merged frame has a
    row for every date any series traded, so on a day the target's market was
    shut (Columbus Day for a US bond index, say) there is a row but no price.
    Counting rows across it made a "5-day" label a 4-day return and dropped the
    real move across the closed day entirely. That day now gets no label, and
    ``label_end`` records how far each label really reaches so the splitter can
    purge on it.
