"""FYP-42: the Fama-French five-factor benchmark Forecaster.

The factor *data* is already fully built (``ingest/fama_french.py``); what this module
adds is (1) joining that factor data into the same wide frame Bloomberg signals live in,
and (2) a ``Forecaster`` that runs an ordinary least-squares fit instead of a polynomial
one.

**Design decision:** the classic Fama-French regression explains *today's* return from
*today's* factor moves (attribution, not forecasting) — but this project needs every
model scored on the same out-of-sample, walk-forward Rank IC as Polynomial and ML. So
``FamaFrench5`` treats the five factors as lagged predictive signals, exactly like any
Bloomberg signal flowing through ``align_and_lag()``, not the textbook contemporaneous
use. This keeps "what OOS Rank IC measures" identical across every row of the comparison
table, at the cost of deviating from classical factor-attribution methodology.

**Documented simplification:** the target regressed on is the panel's own forward-return
column, not an "excess return" (target minus the risk-free rate) as classical Fama-French
monthly asset-pricing work would use. ``RF`` is still merged into the frame by
``merge_factors()`` if this needs revisiting; skipping the subtraction keeps
``FamaFrench5`` structurally identical to ``DerivedPolynomial`` (same target column,
same shape) and keeps every model's IC/RankIC/RMSE comparable.
