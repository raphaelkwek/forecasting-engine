"""The Forecaster protocol: the one interface every model family implements.

FYP-42 (Fama-French), FYP-43 (polynomial) and FYP-44 (machine learning) each score
against the same walk-forward harness (``validation/harness.py``) and feed the same
comparison view (``reporting/model_metrics.py``). A shared protocol is what makes that
possible without the harness or the view knowing which model family produced a result.

Nothing here imports Streamlit or a concrete model library; the dashboard and the
model implementations are both callers.
