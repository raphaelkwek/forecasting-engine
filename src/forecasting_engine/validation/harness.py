"""The shared walk-forward harness: fit and predict any Forecaster, fold by fold, and
turn the result into the fixed contract FYP-45/FYP-14 already built the comparison view
and promotion gates against.

FYP-45 already built what happens *after* a model produces fold-by-fold predictions —
``pbo.compute_pbo``, ``crash.crash_diagnostics_over_folds``, ``gates.evaluate_candidate``
— but nothing fit a model and produced those predictions in the first place. This module
is that missing piece: "plug a model into the shared walk-forward harness" means running
it through ``evaluate()``, then ``summarize()`` (one configuration) or
``select_best_candidate()`` + ``summarize()`` (several configurations to compare, like
Polynomial's degree/regularizer grid or Boosted's tuned XGBoost vs. LightGBM).

``evaluate()`` deliberately returns raw predictions and realised values per fold rather
than pre-scored metrics, because each downstream consumer scores differently: crash
diagnostics want the raw series, IC/RankIC/RMSE get averaged across folds, and PBO
needs several *different* models' fold results compared against each other, not one
model's alone (so ``summarize()`` takes an already-computed PBO rather than computing
one itself).
