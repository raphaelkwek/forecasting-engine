"""An append-only log of upload attempts that succeeded.

Deliberately narrow. The architecture design puts full run history in
``store/runs.py`` in Sprint 6; this module records uploads and nothing else, so
that it does not pre-commit the run schema that sprint owns.

The table is an event log: the same file uploaded twice is two rows. What
happened and when is the point, not which distinct files exist.
